# Discrete and Continuous Naive Bayes 

This is a piece work from COMP30027 Machine Learning Project 1(University of Melborune).

We finished this work in 04/2020 with Python programming.

In this Project, I implement a supervised Naive Bayes learner and evaluate it with respect to various supervised datasets. And then use the observations to respond to some conceptual questions about naive Bayes. 

code.ipynb is the code file, analysis.pdf is the comment for two questions. (Q1: Why discretizing the variables improve classification performance, compared to the Gaussian Naive Bayes approach? Q5: Does changing the smoothing regime affect the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes classifier? Others are datasets.
